# feature-based-image-classifier

This project implements an image classification pipeline using traditional feature extraction techniques and machine learning classifiers. The system uses Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Color Histograms, and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to extract features from images. Classification is performed using KNN and K-means (both implemented from scratch), and Support Vector Machines (using scikit-learn).
